# Agent Update Summary

All EFIR agents have been updated with comprehensive role instructions based on the CLAUDE CODE TOOLING PROMPT PACK.

## Completed Updates:
1. ✅ efir_master_agent - Master orchestrator with routing matrix
2. ✅ product_architect_agent - Guardian of PRD/FRS/DHG with complete formulas

## Remaining Agents to Update:
The following agents still need detailed instruction updates based on the tooling prompt pack:

- system_architect_agent
- database_supabase_agent  
- backend_engine_agent (CRITICAL - owns ALL calculations)
- backend_api_agent
- frontend_ui_agent
- governance_versioning_agent
- reporting_statements_agent
- data_migration_agent
- performance_agent
- security_rls_agent
- documentation_training_agent
- qa_validation_agent

These agents have basic structures but need enhancement with:
- Detailed NEVER/MUST rules
- Output format specifications
- Tool recommendations
- Code style guidelines
- Validation checklists

Next: Update backend_engine_agent as it's the most critical (calculation logic core)
