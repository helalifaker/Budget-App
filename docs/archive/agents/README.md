# Archived Agent Definitions

**Status**: ARCHIVED - Historical Reference Only
**Archived Date**: December 2025

---

## Overview

This folder contains **archived agent definitions** that are no longer active in the current EFIR Budget App development workflow. These files are preserved for historical reference and context.

## Why These Were Archived

The agent system was consolidated and simplified. These specialized agents were either:
- **Merged** into broader agents for efficiency
- **Deprecated** as the codebase matured
- **Replaced** by simpler development patterns

## Active Agents

For current active agents, see:

- **[.claude/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md](../../../.claude/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md)** - Master agent guide
- **[.claude/agents/](../../../.claude/agents/)** - Active agent definitions
