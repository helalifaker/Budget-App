# Minimum coverage percentage
# Current: 78% (78.49% achieved with all tests passing)
# Target: Increase to 80%+ as test coverage improves
#
# PARALLEL TESTING NOTES:
# - Parallel testing (-n auto) is DISABLED by default due to test isolation issues
#   with SQLite file-based databases causing race conditions
# - To run tests in parallel locally (faster but less reliable):
#   pytest -n auto --dist loadfile
# - Each worker gets its own SQLite database file (see conftest.py)
